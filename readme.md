# 💌 forher

A simple, heartfelt, handwritten-style webpage — made to surprise someone very special.

## 🌸 Purpose

This project is a personal, poetic love letter built using HTML, CSS, and a dash of animation. It's designed to feel like opening a physical envelope, revealing something meaningful inside.

Inspired by:
- A 7-hour late night call
- The nickname "my goofball"
- A desire to make her feel as special as she is

## 📁 Structure

- `index.html` — The main page
- `assets/` — Contains images, video (envelope animation), and other media
- `style.css` — Embedded in the HTML for simplicity

## 🛠 Tech Used

- Pure HTML/CSS (no JS frameworks)
- Typing + reveal animation
- Mobile-friendly and responsive
- Hosted via GitHub Pages

## 🚧 Privacy Note

Due to GitHub Pages limitations, this repository is currently public. Sensitive images or details may be replaced, blurred, or hosted externally for privacy.

Made with love — not for the internet, but for *her*.
